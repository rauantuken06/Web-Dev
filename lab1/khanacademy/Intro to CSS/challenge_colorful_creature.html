        <p>The <em>rabbit</em> is awesome because <strong>Rabbits, or bunnies, are small
            mammals in the family Leporidae (which also includes the hares),<br>
            which is in the order Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas).<br> 
            They are familiar throughout the world as a small herbivore,<br> 
            a prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock, and a pet, having<br> 
            a widespread effect on ecologies and cultures.</strong>.</p>
